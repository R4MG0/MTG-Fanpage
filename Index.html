                            Magic the gathering cards are worth collecting most notably because of the undeniable fact that they enable you build the best deck over time. 
                            When you collect the rare and valuable cards over time, you get to build a deck that may be worth a fortune when the immediate market value is considered.
                            Magic also makes you smarter personality-wise. Whilst games can be very drawn out and seem to take a lot of mental investment, 
                            it teaches you to be gracious in defeat as, after all, it is just a game.
