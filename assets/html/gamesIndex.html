                                At the beginning of a booster draft, each player opens a booster pack and chooses one card. 
                                Then everyone passes the remaining cards in the pack to the player to their left.
                                Each player then picks another card from the pack before passing it on again. You keep doing this 
                                until all the cards from the booster packs have found an owner.
                                Next, each player opens their second booster pack, but this time the remaining cards are passed to the right. 
                                After all the cards have been dealt, the third booster pack is opened and this time passed to the left again.

                                (The illustration above, shows how the packs are passed).

                                After all three packs have been drafted, each player builds a deck from the cards they have chosen.
                                In doing so, each player may add as many standard lands (plains, islands, swamps, mountains, and forests) as they wish,
                                but each deck must have at least 40 cards.
